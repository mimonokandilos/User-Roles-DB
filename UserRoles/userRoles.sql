sql 
In this example, we created a table to store user information, with columns for `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, and `role`. We then created four triggers: 

- `user_password_check`: a `BEFORE INSERT` trigger that checks if a user has a password before they are added to the database. If a user does not have a password, the trigger signals an error with the message "User must have a password".
- `admin_role_check`: a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger that checks if a user is being updated to the admin role. If the user is not currently an admin user, the new role is different from the old role, and the old role is not empty, the trigger signals an error with the message "Only admin users can be assigned to the admin role".
- `moderator_role_check`: a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger that checks if a user is being updated to the moderator role. If the user is not currently an admin user, the new role is different from the old role, the old role is not moderator, and the old role is not empty, the trigger signals an error with the message "Moderator users can only be assigned to the moderator or general role".
- `general_role_check`: a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger that checks if a user is being updated to the general role. If the user is not currently an admin user, the new role is different from the old role, the old role is not moderator, the old role is not admin, and the old role is not empty, the trigger signals an error with the message "General users can only be assigned to the general role".

We then added some sample data to the `users` table and tested the triggers by updating the roles of the sample users. The comments next to each update statement indicate whether the update should succeed or fail based on the role requirements and the expected trigger behavior.

These triggers can help maintain user roles and their requirements in a MySQL database, ensuring that users are assigned the correct role and preventing unauthorized changes to user roles.
