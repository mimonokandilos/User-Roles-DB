The database was tested using the following classes and requirements:


With these triggers, you can ensure that:

Users must have a password when they are added or updated
Only admin users can be updated to an admin role
Moderator users can only be updated to a moderator or general role
General users can only be updated to a general role
You can modify these triggers to suit your specific needs and requirements for user roles in your MySQL database.
